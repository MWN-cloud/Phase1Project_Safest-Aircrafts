# **Business Understanding**

The business is pursuing a new strategic venture in the aviation sector. The objective is to **assist the head of the newly established aviation division** in identifying the **risks associated with aircraft operations**, including **potential operational mishaps** for both **commercial and private aircraft**. The aim is to provide **evidence-based** insights to support informed **decision-making** based on the gathered data.

**Objectives**


1.   Identifying the safest and unsafest aircrafts and their Characteristics
2.   Identifying the major cause of accidents
3.   Identifying the effect of weather on accidents
4.   Does the type of build affect the number of fatalities
5.   Which year had the most casualties


# **Data Understanding**

**Data Cleaning**
Dropping rows and columns with null values
Harmonising data by converting some columns to upper cas

##**Data Manipulation**
Identifying total number of passengers
Identifying aircrafts with the top number of passengers

# **Visualisation**

# **Conclusion**
The conclusion is as below;

1.   The safest aircraft is the Boeing series, followed by Beech.Why;

*   It had the highest number of uninjured passengers. This is attributed to its number of engines(2 and 4). This means that in the event of a loss of 1 engine the other would take over.
*   Since it is a huge carrier, and a public carrier, there are more stringent rules on training of the pilots to reduce the fatalities.

2.   The unsafest aircraft is the Cessna series. Why;

*   The Cessna series is a small aircraft that is most used for training and personal purposes such as recreation. Due to its small number of passengers, it has less stringent rules and therefore more probability to have large number of fatalities
*   Its engine number and type being small may not be able to reduce casualties

3. The reason for most accidents;

*   This has been found to be landing of the plane
*   The purpose of flight is personal - highly likely being recreational

# **Recommendations**

## **For commercial purposes;**

1. The business should consider working with aircrafts with larger carrying capacity and more engines - greater than 2. The recommended aircraft is Boeing and Beech.

## **For private purposes;**
1. The Piper aircraft is safer as it has the same size as the Cessna but with fewer casualties
2. The pilots should have enhanced training on landing aircrafts
3. The company should first focus on aircrafts for training as opposed to recreation to reduce fatalities and avoid the risk of brand reputation and potentially impact the bottom line.
